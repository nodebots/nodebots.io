      <p>NodeBots exists to facilitate sharing code, ideas, and building of robots using
        JavaScript as the control language.</p>

      <p>NodeBots is a technology concept with many facets, but most importantly, it is a community.</p>

      <p>We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from
        intimidation or harassment.</p>

      <p>Towards this end, certain behaviors and practices will not be
        tolerated.</p>

      <h2 id="tl-dr">tl;dr</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Be respectful.</li>
        <li>Abusive behavior is never tolerated.</li>
        <li>Data published to NodeBots is hosted at the discretion of the service administrators, and may be removed.
        </li>
        <li>Don't build evil robots.</li>
        <li>Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the NodeBots community.</li>
        <li>Your local organizer/maintainer will provide contact information for help with abuse.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

      <p>We expect all members of the NodeBots community, including paid and unpaid
        agents, administrators, users, facilitators, and vendors to abide by
        this Code of Conduct at all times in all NodeBots community venues, online
        and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to NodeBots
        affairs.</p>

      <p>This policy covers the usage of the NodeBots forums, as well as the NodeBots
        website, NodeBots related events, and any other services offered under the name of
        NodeBot(s) (collectively, the "Service"). It also applies to
        behavior in the context of the NodeBots Open Source project communities,
        including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, IRC channels,
        social media, mailing lists, and public events.</p>

      <p>This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way
        nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of
        the Service.</p>

      <p>The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory",
        "hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of
        the NodeBots abuse team.</p>

      <h2 id="friendly-harassment-free-space">Friendly Harassment-Free Space</h2>

      <p>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
        environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual
        orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical
        appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.</p>

      <p>We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion
        regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation
        choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a
        single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a
        license to be rude.</p>

      <p>Disputes over package rights must be handled respectfully, according
        to the terms described in the NodeBots Dispute Resolution document. There
        is never a good reason to be rude over package name disputes.</p>

      <p>Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing
        behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.</p>

      <p>Harassing other users of the Service is never tolerated, whether via
        public or private media.</p>

      <p>Avoid using offensive or harassing package names, nicknames, or other
        identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming
        environment for all.</p>

      <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial
        verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual
        orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical
        appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics;
        inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit
        language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm;
        deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography
        or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
        inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

      <h2 id="acceptable-package-content">Acceptable Content</h2>

      <!--
    TODO: This should probably be split out into a separate doc.  Maybe
    just link to the appropriate location in the Terms of Use once we have
    it.
    -->

      <p>The Service administrators reserve the right to make judgement calls
        about what is and isn't appropriate in published content. These are
        guidelines to help you be successful in our community.</p>

      <p>Content must contain something applicable to the previously stated goals of the NodeBots community. "Spamming",
        that is,
        publishing any form of content that is not applicable, is not allowed.</p>

      <p>Content must not contain illegal or infringing content. You should
        only publish content to the Service if you have
        the right to do so. This includes complying with all software license
        agreements or other intellectual property restrictions. For example,
        redistributing an MIT-licensed module with the copyright notice
        removed, would not be allowed. You will be responsible for any
        violation of laws or others’ intellectual property rights.</p>

      <p>Content must not be malware. For example, content (code, video, pictures, words, etc.) which is
        designed to maliciously exploit or damage computer systems, is not
        allowed. </p>

      <p>Content name, description, and other visible metadata must not include
        abusive, inappropriate, or harassing content.</p>

      <h2 id="reporting-violations-of-this-code-of-conduct">Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct</h2>

      <p>If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this
        Code of Conduct, please contact your local organizer or repo maintainer to send an
        abuse report. If this is the initial report of a problem, please
        include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address
        issues when we have more context.</p>

      <h2 id="copyright-violations">Copyright Violations</h2>

      <p>We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do
        too. If you believe any package or other materials available through
        the Service violates a copyright held by you and you would like to
        submit a notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or
        other similar international law, you can submit a notice to our agent
        for service of notice at github:</p>

      <p><a
          href="https://github.com/nodebots/nodebots.io/issues/new">https://github.com/nodebots/nodebots.io/issues/new</a>
      </p>

      <p>Please make sure your notice meets the Digital Millennium Copyright
        Act requirements.</p>

      <h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>

      <p>All content published to the Service, including user account
        credentials, is hosted at the sole discretion of the NodeBots
        administrators.</p>

      <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors,
        employees, customers, or others with decision-making authority, will
        not be tolerated.</p>

      <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
        immediately.</p>

      <p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the NodeBots
        administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and
        including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community
        without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or
        service).</p>

      <h2 id="addressing-grievances">Addressing Grievances</h2>

      <p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating
        this Code of Conduct, you should notify the NodeBots team. We will do our best
        to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.</p>

      <p>In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being
        most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.</p>

      <h2 id="contact-info">Contact Info</h2>

      <p>Please contact your local organizer or repo maintainer if you need to report a problem or
        address a grievance related to an abuse report.</p>

      <p>You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about
        something that might be "on the line" between appropriate and
        inappropriate content. We are happy to provide guidance to help you
        be a successful part of our community.</p>
