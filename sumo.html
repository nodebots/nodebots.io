<h3>Dimensions</h3>
<p>Sumo bots must fit into an 6"x6"x6" cube. The "arena" will be a 3'-diameter circle on a flat surface.</p>

<h3>Competition rules</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Each match will consist of 3 rounds of 60 seconds each between 2 robots</li>
	<li>The winner of each match will compete against winners of other matches, until one robot is determined to be the Grand Champion Sumo Bot</li>
	<li>While damage/destruction is inevitable, it is not encouraged. Robots that purposely attempt to ruin their competition will be put in timeout with a professional finger-wagger for the remainder of the competition.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If a robot leaves the competition arena, the opposing robot wins the round</li>
	<li>The first robot to win 2 rounds winds the match.</li>
	<li>If neither robot wins the round, the match judge will choose the winner, based on something whimsical and/or random, probably style.</li>
</ul>
